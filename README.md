# kandinskyplus.py

an extended python graphic library for Numworks.
Based on the built-in kandinsky library

## functionality

 - `fill_circle()` A function that draws a circle using the coordinates of the center and the radius of the circle
 - To be inplemented `fill_line` To draw a line between 2 points
 - To be inplemented `fill_triangle` To draw a triangle using the coordinate of 3 points


for now the algorithm that fill circle is ineficient (take about half a second to draw a circle with a radius of 50 pixels), it will be change in the future.
